              <br>
              This is an invitation to participate in a research study which I am undertaking as part of my Master of Arts in Education and Society program at McGill University. My study aims to investigate the motivations of university students in Montreal who are involved in creating video content on social media with a particular focus on its viability as a potential career. It seeks to understand the driving forces behind students' involvement in pursuing video content creation.

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <br>
              Social media and video content creation have become integral aspects of modern communication and entertainment. This integration not only offers new career opportunities but also provides valuable insights into how young people shape their future professions through these platforms. To explore the motivations of Montreal's university students engaged in video content creation on social media, especially regarding its potential as a career path, our project conducted semi-structured interviews with six video creators from different universities in Montreal.
              <br><br>
              <h4>Researh Question</h4>
              <br>
              What are the motivations driving Montreal's university students to engage in video content creation on social media platforms as a potential career path?

Community building emerged as a prominent motivation among all participants, fostering a sense of connection and loyalty within their respective audiences. Education and tutorial content served as motivators for some students, as they utilized social media to share knowledge and experiences. Storytelling also emerged as a significant motivation factor, allowing students to engage and captivate their audience while sharing unique narratives and insights.
              <br><br>
              <h4>Perception of Success & Career Aspirations </h4>
